# hello-world
My very first github repository, reading from the learning lab on how to use it.

Hello World!

tinyelm here, learning how-to commit? i've never done that in real life. maybe my alter github ego can learn to.
asking for a story about a dinosaur is the best way to make someone comfortable when you meet them.
i want to learn how the modern programmer works in today's racket.

--this is my first edit to the hello-world document--
